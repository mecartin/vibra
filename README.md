        ```env
        # vibra-backend/.env

        # Server Configuration
        PORT=5000

        # MongoDB Connection
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

        # JWT Authentication
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

        # Spotify API Credentials
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
        SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/api/spotify/callback

        # Frontend URL for redirects
        FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

        # Giphy API Key
        GIPHY_API_KEY=your_giphy_api_key

        # ML Server URL
        ML_API_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:5001/analyze](http://127.0.0.1:5001/analyze)
        ```
    * **Get Spotify Credentials:** Create an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Add `http://localhost:5000/api/spotify/callback` to the list of Redirect URIs in your Spotify app settings.
    * **Get Giphy Credentials:** Create an app on the [Giphy Developers portal](https://developers.giphy.com/).

3.  **Machine Learning Server Setup:**
    * Navigate to the ML directory from `vibra-backend`:
        ```bash
        cd ml
        ```
    * Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root `vibra` directory:
        ```bash
        cd vibra-frontend
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `vibra-frontend` root and add the following:
        ```env

        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```

### Running the Application

You need to run three separate processes in three different terminal windows.

1.  **Terminal 1: Run the ML Server** (from `vibra-backend/ml`)
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the vibra-backend/ml directory
    python emotion_server.py
    ```
    This will start the Flask server, typically on port 5001.

2.  **Terminal 2: Run the Backend Server** (from `vibra-backend`)
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the vibra-backend directory
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Node.js server, typically on port 5000.

3.  **Terminal 3: Run the Frontend App** (from `vibra-frontend`)
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the vibra-frontend directory
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the Vibra application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
